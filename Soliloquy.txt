I like talking to myself and pretending there's more than one me. This file will be used to jot down our thoughts throughout the project. Without further ado,

Phase 1: OAS
To write the OAS, one must first understand what's to be done. List out the resources, and for each, the possible methods.
While you want to do something to indicate that there's a thread, a stream of images, that kind of thing may not be handled here. In short, 
we really might just be dealing with resources, their methods, and nothing more.
