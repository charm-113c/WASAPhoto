This document provides details on certain operations. This mainly involves
specifying where necessary parameters absent in the URI will be.

- OpID getUserProfile: 
rt.router.GET("/users/:username/profile", rt.getUserProfile) 

The username specified in the URI belongs to the target user, i.e. the user whose profile we 
want to get. In order to perform authentication (that is, check the subject of the bearer auth. 
token and confirm it belongs to the requesting user), we need to know who the requesting user is.
For that matter, we need the Client to send the requester's username in header field:
"requesting-user"

- OpID commentPhoto:
rt.router.POST("/photos/:uploaderID/:photoID/comments", rt.commentPhoto)

A comment needs two more identifiers: commentID and commenterID. CommentID will be automatically 
generated backend, and as such is not needed as input. As the request body will contain the 
comment body, metadata will be sent in custom header fields:
"commenter-username"
"upload-date" 
---

- OpID uncommentPhoto:
rt.router.DELETE("/photos/:uploader/:photoID/comments/:commentID", rt.uncommentPhoto)

Since we need to identify the requesting user, the username will be required in custom 
header field:
"requesting-user"
---

-OpID uploadPhoto:
This OpID is detailed in the "multipart-form-data.txt" file.
